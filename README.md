# SMITE
Sudden Magnitudinous Impactor Triggered Evolution model
-------------------------------------------------------
This model acts as an additional module for the SCION code, serving to inject extraterrestrial impacts into the SCION/SCI-FI model; from here, extent of damage is analysed so as to investigate how these impact events alter a planet's evolution

The files included here should replace files of the same name within the SCI-FI model; SCI-FI can be found at https://github.com/KhushGrg/SCI-FI (thanks to K. Gurung, 2024 and B.J. Mills, 2019)

The forcing file INTERPSTACK_CORE must be placed within the forcings folder, but does not replace existing forcings

m_map must be included to run SMITE and SCI-FI; m_map can be found at https://www-old.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html (thanks to Pawlowicz, R., 2020)
